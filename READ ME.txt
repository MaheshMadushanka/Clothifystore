Project Timeline (12 days)
Days 1-2: Research and analysis, create requirement list and use case diagram.
Days 3-4: Design the ER diagram and wireframes for the web application.
Days 5-6: Develop a prototype design using Figma or Adobe XD.
Days 7-10: Begin development focusing on key components: user management, product catalog, and shopping cart.
Days 11-12: Integrate JWT-based authentication, finalize order management, and perform testing/quality assurance.
Use Case Diagram
Create a diagram that includes:

User interactions for registration, login, viewing products, adding to cart, and placing orders.
Admin actions like adding, updating, and managing product stock.
ER Diagram
Focus on entities such as:

User: (ID, Email, Password, Name, Address, etc.)
Product: (ID, Name, Description, Category, Price, Stock)
Order: (ID, UserID, OrderDate, Status, TotalAmount)
Cart: (UserID, ProductID, Quantity)
Wireframe
Design wireframes for:

User Dashboard: Navigation bar, product categories, and product list.
Admin Dashboard: Add/update products and view orders.
Shopping Cart and Checkout pages.
Prototype Design
Use Figma or Adobe XD for interactive mockups, including user and admin views.

Requirements Analysis
Ensure you capture:

User registration and authentication flow.
Product management features.
Real-time inventory updates and order confirmation process.
Research Tips
Review industry standards for JWT implementation.
Study security practices like hashing passwords (e.g., bcrypt) and using HTTPS (TLS/SSL).
This approach will guide you through efficient project management and successful completion.
